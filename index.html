      <h1>Morning Routine</h1>

      <p>
        On awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead. 
        We consider our plans for the day. Before we begin, we ask God 
        to direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced 
        from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking motives. Under these 
        conditions we can employ our mental faculties with assurance, 
        for after all God gave us brains to use. Our thought-life will 
        be placed on a much higher plane when our thinking is cleared 
        of wrong motives.
      </p>

      <p>
        In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not 
        be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for 
        inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax and 
        take it easy. We don’t struggle. We are often surprised how the 
        right answers come after we have tried this for a while. What 
        used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration gradually 
        becomes a working part of the mind. Being still inexperienced 
        and having just made conscious contact with God, it is not 
        probable that we are going to be inspired at all times. We might 
        pay for this presumption in all sorts of absurd actions and 
        ideas. Nevertheless, we find that our thinking will, as time 
        passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration. We come to 
        rely upon it. 
      </p>

      <p>
        We usually conclude the period of meditation with a prayer that 
        we be shown all through the day what our next step is to be, 
        that we be given whatever we need to take care of such problems. 
        We ask especially for freedom from self-will, and are careful to 
        make no request for ourselves only. We may ask for ourselves, 
        however, if others will be helped. We are careful never to pray 
        for our own selfish ends. Many of us have wasted a lot of time 
        doing that and it doesn’t work. You can easily see why. 
      </p>

      <p>
        If circumstances warrant, we ask our partners or friends to join us 
        in morning meditation. If we belong to a religious denomination 
        which requires a definite morning devotion, we attend to that 
        also. If not members of religious bodies, we sometimes select and 
        memorize a few set prayers which emphasize the principles we have 
        been discussing. There are many helpful books also. Suggestions 
        about these may be obtained from one’s spiritual leader. Be quick to 
        see where religious people are right. Make use of what they offer. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As we go through the day we pause, when agitated or doubtful, and 
        ask for the right thought or action. We constantly remind ourselves 
        we are no longer running the show, humbly saying to ourselves many 
        times each day “Thy will be done.” We are then in much less danger 
        of excitement, fear, anger, worry, self-pity, or foolish decisions. 
        We become much more efficient. We do not tire so easily, for we are 
        not burning up energy foolishly as we did when we were trying to 
        arrange life to suit ourselves. 
      </p>

      <p>
        It works–it really does. 
      </p>

      <p>
        We are undisciplined. So we let God discipline us in the simple way 
        we have just outlined.
