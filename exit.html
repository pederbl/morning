      <h1>Morning Routine</h1>

      <p>
        When we retire at night, we constructively review our day. Were we 
        resentful, selfish, dishonest or afraid? Do we owe an apology? Have 
        we kept something to ourselves which should be discussed with another 
        person at once? Were we kind and loving toward all? What could we 
        have done better? Were we thinking of ourselves most of the time? Or 
        were we thinking of what we could do for others, of what we could 
        pack into the stream of life? But we must be careful not to drift 
        into worry, remorse or morbid reflection, for that would diminish our 
        usefulness to others. After making our review we ask God's forgiveness 
        and inquire what corrective measures should be taken.
